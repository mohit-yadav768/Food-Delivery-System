# QuickBites (A2 Module B)

QuickBites is a multi-role food delivery web application built with Flask + MySQL.
It includes separate experiences for:

- Customer
- Restaurant Manager
- Delivery Partner
- Admin (via main portal)

---

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Flask
- Database: MySQL
- Auth: Session token stored in DB (`Sessions` table)
- Frontend: Jinja templates + Vanilla JS + CSS
- Maps: Leaflet + browser geolocation

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.10+ (recommended)
2. MySQL Server 8+
3. pip

---

## 1) Database Setup

1. Open MySQL and run the SQL dump:

```sql
SOURCE path/to/Module B/sql/SQL_Dump.sql;
```

or import it from MySQL Workbench.

2. By default, the app expects:

- Host: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `3306`
- User: `qb_admin`
- Password: `qb_admin@123`
- Database: `QB`

If your DB credentials are different, set environment variables before running:

- `QB_DB_HOST`
- `QB_DB_PORT`
- `QB_DB_USER`
- `QB_DB_PASSWORD`
- `QB_DB_NAME`

Optional session lifetime env variable:

- `QB_SESSION_HOURS` (default `8`)

---

## 2) Python Environment Setup

From `Module B`:

```powershell
cd app
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies:

- Flask==3.0.3
- mysql-connector-python==9.0.0
- bcrypt==4.2.0

---

## 3) Run the App

From `Module B/app`:

```powershell
python app.py
```

Open in browser:

- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

---

## 3.1) Run with Makefile (Linux/macOS or Windows with make installed)

From `Module B`:

```powershell
make run
```

Useful targets:

- `make venv` -> create virtual environment if missing
- `make install` -> install dependencies in virtual environment
- `make run` -> venv + install + run app
- `make clean` -> remove virtual environment

If PowerShell says `make` is not recognized, use `run.ps1` (below).

---

## 3.2) Run with PowerShell Script (Windows)

From `Module B`:

```powershell
.\run.ps1 -Target run
```

Useful targets:

- `.\run.ps1 -Target venv`
- `.\run.ps1 -Target install`
- `.\run.ps1 -Target run`
- `.\run.ps1 -Target clean`
- `.\run.ps1 -Target help`

If script execution is blocked:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\run.ps1 -Target run
```

---

## 4) Role Portals / Routes

- Main login/signup portal: `/`
- Customer portal: `/customer`
- Customer sub-pages: `/customer/restaurants`, `/customer/browse`, `/customer/cart`, `/customer/profile`
- Restaurant dashboard: `/restaurant`
- Delivery dashboard: `/delivery`

After login/signup, users are auto-redirected to their role portal.

## Indexing + Benchmarking (SubTask 4-5)

This repo includes:

- SQL indexes targeting the app's most frequent WHERE/JOIN/ORDER BY patterns: `sql/indexes.sql`
- A reproducible benchmark runner that captures timings + `EXPLAIN` plans before vs after indexing: `app/benchmark_indexing.py`

### Apply Indexes (SubTask 4)

After importing `sql/SQL_Dump.sql`, apply the indexes:

```sql
USE QB;
SOURCE path/to/Module B/sql/indexes.sql;
```

### Benchmark Before vs After (SubTask 5)

From `Module B/app` (inside the same venv you use to run the app):

```bash
python3 benchmark_indexing.py --mode full
```

If you changed the seed credentials or want to benchmark different sample IDs, pass them explicitly (example):

```bash
python3 benchmark_indexing.py --mode full \
	--customer-id 2 --restaurant-id 202 --partner-id 12 \
	--admin-email aman.shah1@example.com --admin-password pwd1 \
	--customer-email riya.patel2@example.com --customer-password pwd2 \
	--partner-email driver1@example.com --partner-password drv1
```

This will:

- Drop the optimisation indexes (if present)
- Record query timings + API timings + `EXPLAIN` output (BEFORE)
- Apply the optimisation indexes
- Record the same metrics again (AFTER)

It prints the path to a JSON report written under `Module B/logs/` (for example `logs/index_benchmark_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.json`).

If you only want to apply or drop indexes:

```bash
python3 benchmark_indexing.py --mode apply
python3 benchmark_indexing.py --mode drop
```

- Cross-role access controls via role mapping tables
- Audits API backed by database logs with file fallback/sync behavior

---

## Logging

Logs are written under `Module B/logs`:

- `audit.log`: data mutation and audit events
- `activity.log`: auth and activity events
- `audit_sync_state.json`: tracks DB-to-file audit sync progress

---

## Notes

- This project uses soft-delete patterns for many entities.
- Passwords are handled with bcrypt hashing logic in backend flows.
- Leaflet map features require internet access for map tiles.

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

1. App starts but DB errors appear:
- Verify MySQL is running.
- Check DB credentials/env vars.
- Re-import `sql/SQL_Dump.sql`.

2. Login fails for seeded users:
- Ensure dump loaded successfully.
- Seed data includes plaintext passwords that are migrated to bcrypt on successful login.

3. Map not loading:
- Check internet access and browser geolocation permissions.
