JUSTIFICATION = """
SHARD KEY JUSTIFICATION
=======================

Chosen shard key : customerID

1. High Cardinality
   customerID is a unique integer assigned to every registered user.
   With N customers there are N distinct values, guaranteeing that the
   hash function can spread rows evenly across any number of shards.

2. Query-Aligned
   Almost every API call in QuickBites begins with a customer context:
     * Place order / view cart       (customerID lookup)
     * Payment history               (customerID lookup)
     * Address book                  (customerID lookup)
     * Order tracking                (orderID -> customerID lookup)
   Routing on customerID therefore minimises cross-shard fan-out for
   the dominant read/write workloads.

3. Stable
   customerID is assigned once at registration and never updated.
   It satisfies the "does not change frequently" stability criterion,
   which means a record never needs to be migrated between shards
   after its initial insertion.

PARTITIONING STRATEGY
=====================
Strategy chosen : Hash-based modulo
Formula         : shard_id = customerID % NUM_SHARDS

Why hash-based over range-based:
  * Range partitioning on customerIDs 1-10 would create hotspots if
    new customers arrive sequentially (shard N always gets new writes).
  * Hash-based partitioning distributes writes uniformly across all
    shards irrespective of the ID sequence.
  * The formula is deterministic and O(1) -- no directory lookup needed.

Why not directory-based:
  * Directory lookup adds a network hop (or an extra DB read) on every
    query.  For a food-delivery app with high QPS this is undesirable.
  * Directory-based sharding is more useful when shards need to be
    remapped without rehashing, which is not a requirement here.

SKEW RISKS
==========
  * Small dataset (10 customers, 3 shards): inherent remainder imbalance
    (4-3-3 split).  At production scale (>10k customers) the modulo hash
    converges to near-uniform distribution.
  * Power users placing many orders do NOT create key skew because every
    shard still routes on customerID; a single customer's orders all go
    to the same shard, keeping individual queries local.
  * Future risk: if customerIDs cluster in multiples of NUM_SHARDS
    (e.g., all even IDs for a batch import) then shard(even) = 0 or 2
    only.  Mitigation: use a murmur/fnv hash instead of plain modulo for
    large-scale deployment.
